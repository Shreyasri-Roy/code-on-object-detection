# code-on-object-detection
Using this code we can detect individual objects in an image using the principle of computer vision.
Here I have used python and OpenCV to design the code. Here I have used SSD-MobileNetv3 algorithm to design the code.
Also here I have taken deep learning pre-trained models provided in the official github link of OpenCV, based on Tensorflow. The source files for configuration ,frozen model ,image file,and the main code files are attached here.
